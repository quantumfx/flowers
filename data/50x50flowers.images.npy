This presentation focuses on research surrounding machine learning of discrete-valued  gene expression datasets using clustering, with the aim of identifying gene co-expression networks. Specifically, a number of topics surrounding the use of mixture models and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for clustering of discrete data from high-throughput transcriptome sequencing technologies will be presented. After outlining current challenges and gaps in research with respect to clustering approaches, several mixture model-based clustering methods will be presented. Significance, innovation, limitations and a number of future directions stemming from this research will be discussed." href="go.php/426/index.php"><nobr>2019-04</nobr></a> <a class="archivemove" title="Monthly user meeting at SciNet with pizza, a techtalk and user discussion. &quot;The Grammar and Tools of Data Visualization in the Era of Big Data&quot;,by Mubdi Rahman, Ph.D (Dunlap Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics, University of Toronto).Data visualization has become a critical tool for scientists in exploratory science, particularly in the light ever-growing datasets with greater complexity.Despite this, the basics of visualization are often misunderstood and we limit ourselves to classical formats and tools that end up being inefficient and misleading.In this talk, I'll present some of the basic grammar of how to build visualizations for exploratory science, and modern tools that enable thework." href="go.php/424/index.php"><nobr>2019-02</nobr></a> <a class="archivemove" title="Pizza and presentation by PhD student Stephanie Penk: &quot;Making a modeler; on the use  of supercomputers in ecological systems.&quot;" href="go.php/416/index.php"><nobr>2018-11</nobr></a> <a class="archivemove" title="Pizza and discussion about the Resource Allocation Competition" href="go.php/411/index.php"><nobr>2018-10</nobr></a> <a class="archivemove" title="George Stein (Dept. of Astronomy-UofT, CITA) &quot;Machine learning cosmic structure formation&quot; + pizzaAbstract:In modern astrophysics and cosmology, accurate simulations of the large scale structure of the universe are necessary. Usually, this is accomplished by so called N-body simulations, which calculate the full gravitational collapse of a region of the universe over its 14 billion year history. Instead of calculating this costly gravitational evolution, we trained a three-dimensional deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify dark matter proto-haloes directly from the cosmological initial conditions, and showed that a CNN of this type can be a viable alternative in some cases. In this talk I will discuss current cosmological simulations and the invasion of machine learning techniques, with a focus on our work.For more information see https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04537Please register for pizza purposes!" href="go.php/410/index.php"><nobr>2018-09</nobr></a> <a class="archivemove" title="At this user group meeting, SciNet will present a quick introduction how to use the new supercomputer Niagara.

The supercomputer will accept over 6.5 Tb/s of 4+4-bit complex numbers from 128 custom FPGAs, and correlate this data on GPUs; an operation which requires about 7 peta integer operations per second. The current system design calls for 256 Intel Haswell based compute nodes, and a total of 1024 AMD Fiji XT GPUs, each with 4096 stream processors and 4GB of HBM memory.  The network will consist of 1024 x 10Gb fiber Ethernet links. To reduce costs the system makes use of commodity hardware, careful software and network stack optimizations, and direct-to-chip water-cooling.
